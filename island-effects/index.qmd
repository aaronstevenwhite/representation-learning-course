## Reading
1. @sprouse_experimental_2016 on variation in the strength of island effects on acceptabiliy judgments. We will use the data collected for that paper, which can be found [here](https://www.jonsprouse.com/data/NLLT2016/), in this module.
2. @sprouse_acceptability_2018 on the relationship between acceptability and grammaticality. We will specifically be concerned with his discussion of what apparent gradience in acceptability implies about discreteness v. continuity in grammatical representations.
