## Reading

**Data:** @white_frequency_2020 on collecting a broad-coverage acceptability judgment dataset focused on complement clauses and @white_computational_2016 on using that dataset to develop a computational model of selection. We will use the data collected for those papers, which can be found [here](http://megaattitude.io/projects/mega-acceptability/), in this module.

**Theory:** @lohninger_typology_2020 on the typology of complement clauses. We will specifically be concerned with their hypothesis that the distributional complement clauses is constrained by a monotonicity constraint relating ordered semantic types to ordered syntactic types.
