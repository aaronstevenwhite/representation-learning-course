## Reading

**Data:** @reisinger_semantic_2015 and @white_universal_2020 on collecting corpus annotations of the proto-role properties proposed by @dowty_thematic_1991. We will use the Universal Decompositional Semantics (UDS) dataset [v2.0 @gantt_decomposing_2022], which is packaged with the decomp toolkit, available [here](https://github.com/decompositional-semantics-initiative/decomp). 

**Theory:** @levin_argument_2005[Ch. 2] on the explanatory role of generalized thematic roles.
