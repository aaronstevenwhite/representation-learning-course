## Reading

**Data:** @degen_prior_2021 on how prior beliefs modulate projectivity inferences. We will use the data collected for that paper, which can be found [here](https://github.com/judith-tonhauser/projective-probability), in this module. 

**Theory:** @degen_factive_2022 and @kane_intensional_2022 on whether there is a discrete category of factive predicates. We will specifically be concerned with Degen and Tonhauser's discussion  discussion–broadly, but most specifically in Section 4–about the sources of gradience.
